# Crowd Watch

**Author:** Kris

**Version:** 1.0

## About

This is a web application created to keep track of how people move and where they congregate.

Powered by user reports, the app keeps track of where crowds develop and predicts where crowds may develop in the future. 

This project follows crowds in different settings - from hiking trails to public transportation - allowing the user to pinpoint peak demand and avoid crowds. Think of it as a load balancer to solve the problem of overcrowding.

## Domains

## Tooling
This is a **Django** project, where each domain is an app within the project.

**PostgreSQL** is used for the database.

Django's template system is used as the front-end.
